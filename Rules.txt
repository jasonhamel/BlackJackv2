/*
A card is dealt to the player, then the dealer. The user gets a second card 
face up, the dealer gets a second card face down. Each hand is totalled and
the player is given the option to draw another card for their hand. The player
is given the option to draw until they either bust or stay. If the player stays
the dealer reveals their second card. If the dealer has a lower total than the
player, they hit until they win or bust.
